# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Basic Pull Sync Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the initial logic for pulling data from Monday.com and displaying potential updates.
# Details:
1. Create a new module 'pullSyncLogic.js' in the src directory.
2. Implement the main pull sync function:
   - Fetch items from the configured Monday.com board and groups.
   - Compare fetched items with local tasks in tasks.json.
   - Identify new items and updates to existing items.
   - Generate a report of potential updates without writing to tasks.json.
3. Implement field mapping logic (reverse of push sync):
   - Map Monday.com item name to TaskMaster task name.
   - Extract description, details, and test strategy from Monday.com Info Box.
   - Map Monday.com Task ID column to TaskMaster task ID.
   - Map Monday.com Status column to TaskMaster status.
   - Map Monday.com Dependencies column to TaskMaster dependencies.
   - Map Monday.com Priority column to TaskMaster priority.
4. Implement error handling and logging throughout the process.
5. Add functionality to detect conflicts (e.g., local changes that haven't been pushed).
6. Implement batching for Monday.com API calls to optimize performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for the pullSyncLogic module:
   - Test the field mapping logic for various Monday.com item states.
   - Test the main pull sync function with mocked dependencies.
   - Test error handling and edge cases (e.g., API errors, missing fields).
   - Test conflict detection logic.
2. Implement integration tests that use a test Monday.com board and a sample tasks.json file.
3. Use Jest's mocking capabilities to simulate various scenarios and API responses.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Data Fetching Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module responsible for retrieving data from the source system or API, ensuring efficient and reliable data acquisition.
### Details:
This module should handle asynchronous data requests, support pagination or batching if necessary, and provide a clean interface for other modules to access fetched data.

## 2. Implement Data Comparison Module [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop a module to compare newly fetched data against existing local data to identify changes, additions, or deletions.
### Details:
This module will analyze differences at the record and field level to determine what needs to be updated, inserted, or removed during synchronization.

## 3. Create Field Mapping Module [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Build a module that maps fields between the source data structure and the local data model to ensure correct data alignment during sync.
### Details:
This module should handle transformations, data type conversions, and any necessary normalization to maintain data integrity.

## 4. Develop Conflict Detection Module [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Implement logic to detect conflicts when data changes occur simultaneously on both source and local systems.
### Details:
This module should identify conflicting updates and flag them for resolution, possibly integrating with error handling or user intervention workflows.

## 5. Establish Error Handling Module [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create a centralized module to manage errors arising during data fetching, comparison, mapping, and conflict detection.
### Details:
This module should log errors, provide retry mechanisms, and ensure graceful degradation or recovery to maintain sync stability.

## 6. Implement Batching and Sync Orchestration Module [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Design a module to batch data operations and orchestrate the overall pull sync process efficiently.
### Details:
This module will manage the execution order, batch sizes, and timing of sync operations to optimize performance and resource usage.
