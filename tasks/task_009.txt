# Task ID: 9
# Title: Extend CLI for Manual Pull Sync
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the command-line interface to support manually triggering the pull sync process.
# Details:
1. Extend the 'cli.js' module in the src directory.
2. Implement a 'pull' command that triggers the pull sync process.
3. Add options to the pull command:
   - --dry-run: Show what would be pulled without making changes (default behavior for MVP).
   - --verbose: Increase logging detail.
4. Implement user-friendly console output for displaying potential updates.
5. Format the output to clearly show new items, updated items, and potential conflicts.
6. Add error handling and user-friendly error messages.
7. Update the 'help' command to include information about the new pull command.

# Test Strategy:
1. Extend unit tests for the CLI module:
   - Test command parsing and option handling for the pull command.
   - Test the integration with the pull sync logic (using mocks).
   - Test error handling and output formatting for pull results.
2. Implement end-to-end tests that run the CLI with various pull command arguments and verify the output.
3. Use Jest's mocking capabilities to simulate various scenarios and user inputs for pull operations.
