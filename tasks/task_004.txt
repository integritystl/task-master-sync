# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Monday.com API Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a client for interacting with the Monday.com API, focusing on core CRUD operations for items.
# Details:
1. Create a new module 'mondayClient.js' in the src directory.
2. Use the official @monday/api-client package (latest version) for API interactions.
3. Implement functions for:
   - Authenticating with the Monday.com API using the API key from the config.
   - Fetching board and group details.
   - Creating new items.
   - Updating item names.
   - Posting updates to items (for description).
   - Changing status column values.
   - Fetching item details including column values.
4. Implement error handling for API errors, including rate limiting.
5. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for recoverable errors.
6. Implement request batching for mutations to optimize API usage.
7. Add logging for API interactions (using winston 3.x for structured logging).
8. Implement a simple cache for board and group details to reduce API calls.

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests for the mondayClient module:
   - Mock API responses using Jest's mocking capabilities.
   - Test successful API interactions for each implemented function.
   - Test error handling and retry logic.
   - Test request batching functionality.
   - Test caching mechanism for board and group details.
2. Implement integration tests that interact with a test Monday.com board (using a separate API key for testing).
3. Use nock (version 13.x) to mock HTTP requests in tests to simulate various API responses and errors.
